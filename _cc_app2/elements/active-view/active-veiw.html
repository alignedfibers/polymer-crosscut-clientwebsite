    <!-- the last one here will provide a falsy value, then after all elements in this
         component have readied and attached and this component is ready, we will prepend
         the "control route" with the number of active routes. active routes count starts at
         neg(1). Route information will be a property on the binded handlerview in the attrib.
         When two or more routes match, it is ideal for the component to which is listening
         for matches to be well planned and to have a method to show the views it serves.
         a view will be able to impliment this element and create views of its own, note:
         it appears that <app-route> updates whenever it's route passed in updates, at this
         point I believe the changes are chained bidrectionally, and no one rule contains
         the prototype of all the rules that proceded it, just containing the result data
         object, thus we can assuredly assume the position in line, where routes will be
         updated. Though the ability to make the assumption on where routes will be matched
         is helpful, we should not be dependent on that sequence. (This reminds me of an
         htaccess redirect loop) 2 or more veiws are possible to handle at one time, these
         two views should be binded so that they can communicate, often one view will request
         to show a subview with details, and update the uri to an acceptable reload uri,
         thus maintaining the view state with the uri across reloads. To avoid collisions,
         or unexpected views fighting for the foreground, each view def can be directly registered
         (recommended preroute) with meta data listing friendly views, when the active view index
         lists an unfriendly view at route check / setActive time, we can push the location for
         the current hot route prefix, but may cause further issues. This situation happens when
         you are currently viewing a "ContactPageView" but that view has no idea what information
         it should be sharing with "DetailView" and someone accidentally or does enter a match
         for both views in the uri path. My recommendation is to provide a toast and to
         default to route based on the defaultRoute set when the path was matched, record the
         redirect, and force stop for redirectloop, toast and redirect to default home, explaining
         to that there has been a routing error, please try again or contact administator.
